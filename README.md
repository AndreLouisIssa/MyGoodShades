# Crowd Control for SGG Games

You need the latest Mod Importer, Mod Utility, and StyxScribe (all from GitHub as Nexus is a bit behind always)

For modders, use the Crowd Control SDK to test effects by loading the a .cs file in Content/CrowdControlContent

For streamers, use the Crowd Control Twitch extension and the Crowd Control app to load a .ccpack file in Content/CrowdControlContent
You may also need the Crowd Control SDK to turn a .cs file into a .ccpack, as that assigns points to the effects.
